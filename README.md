[00:36.71] Transmission, third World War, third round
[00:39.29] A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
[00:41.56] No shelter, if you're looking for shade
[00:43.54] I lick shots at the brutal charade
[00:45.49] As the polls close like a casket, on truth devoured
[00:48.89] A silent play on the shadow of power
[00:50.73] A spectacle monopolized
[00:53.10] The cameras eyes on choice disguised
[01:11.10] 
[00:55.46] Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil
[00:57.69] Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
[00:59.97] Yes, a spectacle monopolized
[01:02.39] They hold the reins, stole your eyes
[01:04.44] All the Fist-a-gons, the bullets, and bombs
[01:06.70] Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
[01:09.61] More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
[01:11.79] None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord!
[01:32.29] 
[01:14.21] Lights out! Guerrilla radio!
[01:17.52] Turn that shit up!
[01:19.00] Lights out! Guerrilla radio!
[01:22.23] Turn that shit up!
[01:23.75] Lights out! Guerrilla radio!
[01:27.10] Turn that shit up!
[01:28.52] Lights out! Guerrilla radio!
[01:42.52] 
[01:32.52] Contact, I hijacked the frequencies
[01:35.35] Blockin' the beltway, move on DC!
[01:37.52] Way past the days of bombin' MCs
[01:39.56] Sound off, Mumia go on be free!
[01:41.70] Who got 'em? Yo, check the federal file
[01:44.49] All you pendejos know the trial was vile
[01:46.65] An army of pigs try to silence my style
[01:49.08] Off 'em all out that box, it's my radio dial!
[02:11.58] 
[01:51.79] Lights out! Guerrilla radio!
[01:54.95] Turn that shit up!
[01:56.34] Lights out! Guerrilla radio!
[01:59.54] Turn that shit up!
[02:01.04] Lights out! Guerrilla radio!
[02:04.04] Turn that shit up!
[02:05.68] Lights out! Guerrilla radio!
[02:08.45] Turn that shit up!
[02:17.45] 
[02:46.61] It has to start somewhere
[02:49.07] It has to start sometime
[02:51.32] What better place than here?
[02:53.42] What better time than now?
[03:06.42] 
[02:57.04] All hell can't stop us now
[03:01.76] All hell can't stop us now
[03:06.47] All hell can't stop us now
[03:11.39] All hell can't stop us now
[03:15.98] All hell can't stop us now
[03:20.82] All hell can't stop us now
